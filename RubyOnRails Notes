Installing Ruby 


	BPDC$ brew install rbenv
	==> Downloading https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/archive/v0.4.0.tar.gz
	######################################################################## 100.0%
	==> Caveats
	To use Homebrew's directories rather than ~/.rbenv add to your profile:
	  export RBENV_ROOT=/usr/local/var/rbenv

	To enable shims and autocompletion add to your profile:
	  if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi
	==> Summary
	üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/0.4.0: 31 files, 152K, built in 25 seconds

	BPDC$ brew install ruby-build


Install ruby latest version
	BPDC$ rbenv install 2.1.2

	even after installing the new ruby version, the system uses the old version.
	To tell the system to use the new version we have to use

	BPDC$ rbenv rehash

	BPDC$ rbenv global 2.1.2

	Note: we can use local/shell instead of global to use ruby for current project or for current shell prompt.


Installing RubyGEMs

	BPDC$ gem -v
	2.2.2
	BPDC$ which gem
	/Users/BPDC/.rbenv/shims/gem

	BPDC$ gem list        		//gems that are currently installed on system

	*** LOCAL GEMS ***
